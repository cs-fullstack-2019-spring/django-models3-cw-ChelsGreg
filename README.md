### Exercise 1
Create a Book model with name, pageNumber, genre, and publishDate attributes. Create 3 entries using 3 different methods (admin site, create method using an endpoint, and class construtor using an endpoint).

Create an 'all/' endpoint that prints out all entry names, create a new endpoint that only prints entries with publish dates greater than or equal to 01/01/2018, and create another new endpoint to change genre of at least one entry with a publish date greater than or equal to 01/01/2018 to "fiction".

### Exercise 2
Create a Car model with make, model, and year attributes. Create 3 entries using 3 different methods (admin site, create method using an endpoint, and class construtor using an endpoint).

Create an 'all/' endpoint that prints out all entry years, create a new endpoint that only prints entries with years greater than 2010, and create another new endpoint to change the models of all entries with year greater than 2010 to be "F150".
